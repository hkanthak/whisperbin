      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

      <p>WhisperBin is a minimal tool designed for one-time, secure sharing of text snippets. We respect your privacy
        and limit data processing to the absolute minimum required to provide this service.</p>

      <h3>Data Collection</h3>
      <p>We do not collect any personal data beyond what you explicitly submit via the WhisperBin form.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Secrets are encrypted in memory and are deleted automatically after the first access or after their
          expiration.</li>
        <li>We do not log the contents of any secret.</li>
        <li>IP addresses may be temporarily processed in-memory solely for rate limiting purposes. They are not stored
          persistently or linked to any other data.</li>
        <li>No cookies are used except for an ephemeral CSRF token cookie, required for security. This cookie is not
          used for tracking or identification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, tracking services, or advertising networks.</p>

      <h3>Legal Basis</h3>
      <p>We process your submitted data based on your explicit request (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR). No profiling or further
        processing is performed.</p>

      <h3>Your Rights</h3>
      <p>As we do not persist your data beyond the intended one-time use, no personal data is stored that can be
        retrieved, corrected, or deleted beyond this mechanism. For inquiries regarding data protection, please contact
        the operator of this instance.</p>

      <h3>Changes</h3>
      <p>This privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes in functionality or legal requirements. The current
        version will always be available on this page.</p>

      <h3>Operator Information</h3>

        regarding this deployment, please contact the operator of the instance.</p>
